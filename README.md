# What are Toxins in Skincare/Makeup

endocrine disruptors, carcinogens, mutagens (causing genetic mutations), estrogen mimickers, and /or allergens are harmful to the environment and aquatic life.

# Classification of Hazard Levels

### Low: allergens, harmful to the environment, irritation

<aside>
üí° 8 ingredients

</aside>

- Ethanolamine
  - contact can severely irritate and burn the skin and eyes, with possible eye damage
- Oxybenzone
  - can cause skin can skin allergies
- Resorcinol
  - Skin irritant and sensitizer: Resorcinol is an acute irritant when in contact with the eyes.¬†There is also evidence that it is a skin irritant and sensitizer
- Formaldehyde
  - Formaldehyde can irritate the eyes, nose, and throat, even at low levels for short periods. Longer exposure or higher doses can cause coughing or choking. Severe exposure can cause death from throat swelling or chemical burns to the lungs.
- Diethanolamine
  - Breathing Aminopropyl Diethanolamine can irritate the nose and throat. \* Breathing Aminopropyl Diethanolamine can irritate the lungs, causing coughing and/or shortness of breath. Higher exposures can cause a build-up of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema), a medical emergency, with severe shortness of breath.
- Siloxanes
  - Also known as cyclical silicones, these compounds are found in a variety of cosmetic and skincare products‚Äîbut they‚Äôre not great for the environment and have been linked with endocrine disruption as well.5 (Dimethicone, on the other hand, is considered safer when used sparingly.)
- Octinoxate
  - This common sunscreen ingredient was originally thought to be harmful to coral reefs, and although it may have been recently proven false, it's still somewhat irritating to sensitive skin.
- ‚ÄåSodium Laureth sulfate or SLS
  - irritation to the skin and eyes

### Moderate: endocrine disruptors, estrogen mimickers

<aside>
üí° 5 ingredients

</aside>

- Phalates
  - Fragrance
  - parfum
- Triclosan
  - interferes with the body's thyroid hormone metabolism and may be a potential endocrine disruptor
- Octinoxates
  - Numerous studies have reported that octinoxate exhibits antiandrogenic activity, which is linked to harmful effects on reproductive organ development in male and female fetuses exposed in utero. These effects can be further passed on to their offspring.
- Homosalate
  - addition to direct health concerns following homosalate exposure, the chemical may also enhance the absorption of pesticides in the body.
- Teflon
  - linked to hormone disruption and reproductive issues

### High: carcinogens & mutagens

<aside>
üí° 4 ingredients

</aside>

- Talc
  - Talc is considered safe for use on the skin though it has been associated with ovarian cancer when used on or near the genitals.
- Parabens
  - The concern with these chemicals is that scientific studies suggest that parabens can disrupt hormones in the body, harm fertility and reproductive organs, affect birth outcomes, and increase cancer risk.
- BHA & BHT
  - BHA and BHT have been linked to quite a few health concerns, including¬†cancer [1], disruption to the hormone system [2], liver damage [3], kidney issues [4], thyroid problems [5], and autoimmunity [6]
    . They can also contribute to changes in fatigue [7], headaches [8], hives [9], and rashes [10].
- Polyethylene glycols
  - various types of cancer

  "One idea is key: Kandinsky‚Äôs proposition that a line is a point set in motion. Analogies between drawing and movement play tag throughout a show of wildly multifarious works."
- [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/harmful-chemicals-in-your-cosmetics)
  "Though Kandinsky is widely credited with inventing abstract painting, art history has generally sided with Malevich, whose ‚ÄúBlack Square‚Äù threw down the gauntlet for nonobjective painting in 1915. That work (which is not on view) provoked Kandinsky to produce the flip response ‚ÄúIn the Black Square,‚Äù which he painted in 1923."
- [EWG](https://www.ewg.org/the-toxic-twelve-chemicals-and-contaminants-in-cosmetics)
  Kandinsky believed that "total abstraction" allowed "complete expression" to occur.
