In data science, interim data refers to data that is generated during the process of data analysis and modeling, but is not the final output of the analysis. Interim data can include intermediate results of data transformations, model inputs and outputs, and other data that is generated during the data analysis process.

Interim data is often used to evaluate the performance of data analysis and modeling techniques, to identify trends and patterns in the data, and to fine-tune the analysis and modeling process. For example, interim data can be used to compare different data transformations or model parameters, to assess the quality of the data and identify potential issues, or to visualize the data and gain insights into the underlying patterns and relationships.

Interim data is typically not the final output of a data analysis project, and is not intended for presentation or reporting. Instead, it is used as a tool for exploring and understanding the data, and for developing and refining the data analysis and modeling techniques. The final output of a data analysis project is typically a summary or presentation of the results of the analysis, which may include charts, graphs, tables, or other visualizations of the data.

In summary, interim data is intermediate data that is generated during the process of data analysis and modeling, and is used to evaluate and refine the analysis and modeling techniques. It is not the final output of the analysis, but is an important tool for understanding and exploring the data.
